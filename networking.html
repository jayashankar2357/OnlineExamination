       NETWORK: </br>
A network is a collection of computers connected together.</br>

NETWORKING: </br>

It is a process of communication between the interconnected devices basically to share the network resources.</br>

Benefits of Networking: </br>

1. Share resources.</br>
i) Data</br>
ii) Hardware</br>
2. Share S/W</br>
3. Sharing of license</br>

Network is a collection of computers connected together to get benefited from networking.</br>

Networking: Networking is a process of communication among systems</br>

Types of Networks </br>

1)Local Area Network (LAN): </br>

Systems connected within the same geographical area is called LAN. A LAN can span 2 kilometers.</br>

Components of LAN:</br>

1. NIC (Network Interface Card)</br>
2. Cable – Co axial, cat5 or cat6</br>
3. Hubs or Switches.</br>

2)Metropolitan Area Networking:</br>

MAN is a combination of LANs or WANS located and connected within the same city.</br>


Components of MAN:</br>


1. Router
2. Brouter (Brouter is a combination of bridge or router)</br>
3. ATM Switches</br>
4. DSL connectivity (DSL – Digital Subscriber Link) ex: Star cables</br>
.
3) Wide Area Networking (WAN): </br>

Interconnection of LANs or MANs located within the same geographical area or different area it depends on telecommunication services.</br>
Network Devices 

Hubs, Switches, Routers and NICs.</br>

HUB: </br>

Hub is a centralized device provides communication among systems when we have more that 2 computers we need to have a device called hub to interconnect.</br>

Disadvantage of a Hub: </br>

1)When we want to transfer some data from one system to another system.</br>
2)If our network has 24 systems the data packet instead of being sent only to the destined system it is being send to all the network participants. (i.e. 24 systems.)</br>
3)Hubs follow broadcasting</br>

SWITCH:</br>

1)It is an advanced version over a Hub.</br>
2)The main benefit of switch is Unicast. Data packets are transmitted only to the target computer instead of all.</br>
3)Switch maintains a table called MIT (Mac Information Table.) which is generated as soon as we turn on the switch, which acts like an index table and easy the process of finding the networked system. MIT contains the port no, IP address and MAC address.</br>

MAC: (Media Access Control): It is an address burnt in the NIC by the manufacturer.</br>
MAC address is of 48 bits in the farm of Hexa decimal.</br>
Every NIC has its own unique MAC address.</br>
MAC address determines the physical location of a system.</br>



ROUTER:</br>

Router is a device connects two different networks.</br>

Class A network with Class C network etc.</br>

Routing is a process of communication between two different networks.</br>



Topology </br>

The way of cabling is called topology.</br>
The architecture of a network is called topology</br>

There are 2 Topologies : </br>

1) Network Topologies</br>
2) Logical Topologies</br>

Network Topologies: </br>

E.g.: Bus, Star, Ring, and Mesh Topologies.</br>

Bus Topology: </br>

Components of Bus Topology:</br>
1. Co-axial cable (back bone cable)</br>
2. T- connectors</br>
3. BNC (British Network Connector)</br>
4. Terminator</br>
5. Patch cable</br>

Disadvantages of Bus:</br>

If anything goes wrong with backbone cable whole network is down.</br>
Follows a serial communication.</br>
Outdated these days.</br>


Star Topology: </br>

Star topology is an advanced version over bus topology. Where it uses either a hub or a switch, it uses cat5/6 cables.</br>
It uses connecters called (Recommend Jack) - RJ45</br>
Star topology offers faster data transfer or processing.</br>


Ring Topology: </br>

Ring topology is useful when we want redundancy (fault tolerance) we go with this type of topology.</br>
Ring topology uses a device called MSAU. (Multi Station Access Unit)</br>
It is a unit inside which a logical ring is formed. This ring ensures the availability of Network. The availability of ring ensures availability of network.</br>
It was basically implemented in IBM networks.</br>


Logical Topologies: </br>

There are 2 types:</br>
1)Work Group</br>
2)Domain</br>


Workgroup (peer to peer): </br>

1 Collection of computers connected together to share the resources.</br>
2 No servers are used.</br>
3 Only Client OS is mostly used.</br>
4 Any O/S like, DOS, 95, 98, workstation, win 2000 pro, and XP pro can be configured as work-group model.</br>
5 Suitable for smaller organizations.</br>
6 Where security is not the criteria.</br>
7 No administrator is required</br>
8 Where we are not using client server based applications. Like oracle, SQL and exchange etc.</br>









Domain (Client/Server): </br>

Domain is a collection of computers connected together with a server and users</br>
Domain model can have servers like UNIX, Novell NetWare, WIN-NT server, 2000 server, and 2003 server.</br>
Provides centralized administration.</br>
Suitable for medium to large size networks/organizations.</br>
Suitable when we have client server architecture (Back ends & front ends)</br>
Domain offers security and provides logon authentication.</br>
Suitable if security is criteria Requires an administrator.</br>

IP-Address </br>

There are two versions of IP's</br>

1. IP version 4: offers IPs up to 4.2 billion (32 bit size)</br>
2. IP version 6: 128 bit size.</br>

IP address is used for identifying the system and provides communication.</br>
IP address is of 32 bits divided in four octets.</br>
Each Octet is of 8 bits, separated by a (.) dot.</br>
IP is a combination of Network ID & Host ID.</br>
Uses subnet mask to differentiate Network ID with Host ID.</br>
Subnet mask acts like a mask between Network ID & the Host ID.</br>
Numbers range between 0-255.</br>

Organizations responsible for assigning IPs to clients.</br>

IANA: Internet Assign Naming Authority.</br>
ICANN: Internet Corporation assigning for name Numbers.</br>





IANA has classified IP addressing into classes. </br>

Class A: 1-126(used in LAN/WAN)</br>
Class B: 128 – 191(used in LAN/WAN)</br>

Class C: 192 – 223(used in LAN/WAN)</br>

Class D: 224 – 239 (used for multi casting)</br>
Class E: 240 – 254 (used for experimentation & research)</br>

Class A:The first octet is reserved for network ID.</br>
The first bit of first octet is always (0).</br>

Class B: The first two octets are reserved for Network IDs.</br>
The first two bits of first octet are reserved as (10)</br>

Class C: The first three octets are reserved as network portions.</br>
The first three bits of first octet are reserved as (110)</br>

Class D: Used for Multicasting.</br>
The first four bits of first octet are reserved as (1110)</br>

Class E: Used for Experimentation.</br>
The first four bits of first octet are reserved as (1111)</br>

The first bit of first octet is called as priority bit which determines the class of N/W</br>

0.0.0.0. Are reserved as N/W ID.</br>
255.255.255.255 is reserved as broadcast ID.</br>
127.0.0.1 Is reserved as loop back ID</br>

Implementing/Configuring TCP/IP:</br>

On Desktop</br>
Right click on my network places-properties</br>
Double click local area network-Select properties</br>
Click-Use the following ip address</br>
Specify the address in the box</br>
DNS also same as IP address.</br>


Verifying: </br>

Go to command promptType” ping IP address”. (PING: Packet Internet Groper</br>
Active Directory </br>

It is a centralized database where it contains the information about the objects like users, groups, computers, printers etc.</br>
AD is a centralized hierarchical Directory Database.</br>
AD is a searchable Database.</br>

2003 O/S. when installed (gets installed as a stand alone server) to promoting to D.C. We have to install A.D.</br>

Domain Controller (D.C.): </br>

A server where A.D. is installed is called D.C.</br>

Functionality of A.D.:</br>

Using A.D. we can organize, manage and control resources.</br>
It provides single point of administration.</br>

Purpose of A.D.: </br>

1. Provides user logon authentication services.</br>
2. To organize and manage user A/Cs, computers, groups and n/w resources.</br>
3. Enables authorized users to easily locate n/w resources.</br>

Features of A.D.: </br>

1. Fully integrated security system with the help of Kerberos.</br>
2. Easy administration using group policy.</br>
3. Scalable to any size n/w</br>
4. Flexible (install/uninstall)</br>
5. Extensible (modify the schema)</br>

New features in 2003</br>

6. Rename computer name & Domain names.</br>
7. Cross –forest trust relationship.</br>
8. Site-to-Site replication is faster.</br>

Evolution of LDAP:</br>

Earlier we had no database standard; hence TTU & ISO introduced X-500</br>

LDAP (Light Weight Directory Access Protocol):</br>

It is an industry standard directory access protocol used for querying and providing communication among the objects in A.D.</br>
It is directory access protocol.</br>
It runs on the port no. 389.</br>

DAP: It is based on OSI model.</br>
LDAP: Is based on TCP/IP model</br>


Removal of Active Directory </br>

Safe removal of A.D.: </br>

>Start >run >dcpromo</br>

Forceful removal of A.D:.</br>

>Start >run > dcpromo /forceremoval</br>

Additional Domain Controller </br>

Requirements: </br>

D.C.</br>
Static .P.</br>
DNS</br>
Stand-alone or Member Server.</br>

Step1: on Stand alone machine or member server </br>

35 Specify I.P.</br>
36 Specify prefer DNS as servers IP.</br>
37 Start > run >ping server’s IP.</br>

Step2: >start >run >dcpromo>next>next>select ADC for an existing domain </br>

38 Specify administrator’s name & pwd.</br>
39 Domain name of DC (eg.zoom.com)</br>
40 Browse the domain</br>
41 Next>next> restore pwd.</br>

ADC is a back up for DC </br>

42 ADC maintains a back up copy of A.D., which will be in read only format.</br>
43 ADCs provide fault tolerance & load balancing</br>
44 There can be any no. of ADCs for a DC.</br>
45 ADCs should be placed and maintained offsite away from the DC.</br>
46 ADC maintains same domain name.</br>

Verifying whether the server is configured as DC or ADC. </br>

47 Start>run>cmd>net accounts</br>
48 For DC we will find “primary”</br>
49 For ADC we will find “Backup” </br>


Active Directory Component </br>

Logical Structure Physical Structure: </br>

Domains sites</br>
Trees Domain Controllers</br>
Forest</br>
Organizational Unit</br>

A.D. Components: </br>

1 Logical structure is useful for organizing the network.</br>
2 Logical components cannot be seen</br>
3 Physical structure is useful for representing our organization for developing the organizational structure.</br>
4 It reflects the organization (mirrors)</br>
5 Physical structure can be seen. Ex. Site – India, US, UK etc.</br>

TREE: </br>

A tree is a group of domains which share contiguous name space.</br>
If more than one domain exits we can combine the multiple domains into hierarchical tree structures.</br>
The first domain created is the root domain of the first tree.</br>
Additional domains in the same domain tree are child domains.</br>
A domain immediately above another domain in the same domain tree is its parent.</br>

FOREST: </br>

Multiple domain trees within a single forest do not form a contiguous namespace. i.e. they have non-contiguous DNS domain names. Although trees in a forest do not share a name space, a forest does have a single root domain, called the forest root domain</br>
The forest root domain is, by definition, the first domain created in the forest.</br>
The two forest wide predefined groups – Enterprise.</br>
Administrators and schema administrators reside in this domain.</br>

Physical structure </br>

SITES: </br>

Site is a combination of TCP/IP, subnets, connected with high-speed links.</br>
Sites provide replication</br>

There are 2 types of replications</br>
1. Intrasite replication</br>
2. Intersite replication</br>

Intrasite Replication: 

It is a replication with in the same site. It offers full time replication between DC & ADC when they are within the same site.</br>

Intersite Replication: </br>

It is a replication between two different sites.</br>
Intersite replication is implemented when the sites are away from each other.</br>

-It requires a site link</br>
-Site link is a logical connection between sites, which can be created & scheduled.</br>
-Site link offers communication only at scheduled intervals.</br>






Practcal Steps for Site </br>
Implementing sites: </br>

Forceful replication: </br>

On DC
Start >programs> admin tools > ADSS > expand sites > default first site>servers</br>
>Expand DC server > NTDS settings >right click on automatically generated</br>
>replicate now>ok.</br>
Repeat the same for DC & ADC</br>

Creating a site: </br>

Open ADSS>Right click on sites>New site>Site name (e.g. UK, US)</br>
Select default site link Ok</br>

Moving ADC into another site: </br>

Select ADC>Right click on ADC>Select move>Select site.</br>

Creating a Site link: </br>

Expand inter site transports>Right click on IP>Select new site link</br>
Link name (ex. Link US –UK)</br>

Scheduling a site link: </br>

Expand inter site transport>IP>Double click on site link>Change schedule</br>
Click on replication not available>set the timings>click on replication available.</br>



NTDS.DIT : </br>
KCC: (Knowledge Consistency Checker): </br>

It is a service of A.D., which is responsible for intimating, or updating the changes made either in DC or ADC.</br>
Active Directory is saved in a file called NTDS.DIT</br>
C:\windows\ntds\ntds.dit</br>


NTDS.DIT - New Technology Directory Services. Directory Information Tree </br>

It is a file logically divided into four partitions.</br>
1. Schema partition</br>
2. Configuration partition</br>
3. Domain partition</br>
4. Application partition</br>

It is a set of rules schema defines AD, it is of 2 parts classes & attributes.</br>
Ad is constructed with the help of classes and attributes.</br>

1. Schema: </br>

Logical partition in AD database “template” for AD database.</br>
• Forms the database structures in which data is stored.</br>
• Extensible</br>
• Dynamic</br>
• Protect by ACL (Access Control Lists) DACLs and SACLs (Directory&System ACLs)</br>
• One schema for AD forest.</br>

Collection of objects is called class.</br>
Piece of information about the object is called attribute.</br>

2. Configuration Partition: </br>

Logical partition in AD database.</br>
1 “map” of AD implementation
2 Contains information used for replication logon searches.</br>
3 Domains</br>
4 Trust relationships</br>
5 Sites& site links</br>
6 Subnets
7 Domain controller locations.</br>

3. Domain Partition: </br>

1 Logical partition in AD database.</br>
2 Collections of users, computers, groups etc.</br>
3 Units of replication.</br>
4 Domain controllers in a domain replicate with each other and contain a full copy of the domain partition for their domain.</br>
5 DCs do not replicate domain partition information for other domains</br>


4. Application Partition: </br>

1 It is a newly added partition in win2003. It can be added or removed</br>
2 It can be replicated only to the specified DCs.</br>
3 Useful when we are using AD integrated services like DNS, TAPI services etc..</br>

Next> specify the new domain name>next</br>
>net bios name>next>database > next</br>
>sysvol>next>DNS next>permission compatible</br>
>next>restore mode pwd>next</br>


Member Server </br>

A server, which is a part of DC, is called Member Server. </br>
Server like WINNT, 2000 and 2003 can be configured as Member Server.</br> 
Server, which is part of the Domain, is called Member Server.</br>

Member Servers are used </br>

Load balancing</br>
Load sharing form DCs</br>

A member server can be configured as any of the following servers. </br>

1) Application service (oracle/SQL)</br>
2) Mail server</br>
3) File server</br>
4) Print server</br>
5) DNS server</br>
6) DHCP sever</br>
7) Web server</br>
8) RIS server</br>
9) RAS server</br>

Select disabled</br>
Apply >ok</br>
Minimum pwd length (do it as 0 characters)</br>
Close</br>
For refreshing policy</br>
Start >run>cmd>gpupdate</br>


Sharing </br>

In order to make a resource to be available over the network and to be accessed by network users we need to implement sharing.</br>

The moment we create a share on a server, server acts like a file server.</br> 

Sharing a resource: </br>
On DC</br>
Open my computer</br>
Select any drive</br>
Create a new folder</br>
Give name of the folder</br>
Right click on the folder</br>
Select sharing and security</br>
Share this folder</br>
Apply > ok</br>

Accessing share resources from a client machine: </br>

On client machine</br>
Open my network places</br>
Entire network</br>
Microsoft windows n/w</br>
Domain name (ex. Zoom)</br>
Computer name</br>

Creating a share through command line: </br>

On DC</br>
Go to command prompt</br>
md sharename</br>
net share sharename=c: \share name</br>

Connecting to a share resource through a command prompt: </br>

On member server</br>
Go to command prompt</br>
net use z:\\computername\sharename</br>

Mapping a drive (connecting to the share from GUI): </br>

On member server</br>
Right click on my computer</br>
Map network drive</br>
Select the drive letter</br>
Uncheck or check reconnect logon</br>
Browse the share folder</br>
Computer name>share name>ok>finish.</br>

Permissions: </br>

Using permissions an administrator can either allow or deny access to a resource.</br>
Resource can be a network resource or local resource</br>

Permissions are of two types: </br>

1. Share level</br>
2. File system or NTFS</br>

Share level permissions </br>

Share level permissions are applied over the network.</br>
Share level permissions are not applied on the local machine where the resource is existing.</br>
There are three types of share level permissions</br>

Full control RWXDO (Read/Write/Execute/Delete/Ownership)</br>
Change RWXD</br>
Read R</br>

Practice: </br>

On DC</br>
Create a share</br>
Create three users</br>
Set permissions</br>

Setting permissions: </br>

Create folder> share> right click on folder> properties> permission</br>
> Remove everyone</br>
>Add all the users whom you want to allow or deny.</br>
>Apply>ok.</br>

Verification: </br>

Move on to client machine</br>
Login as different users</br>
Try to access the n/w resources.</br>

2. NTFS permissions:</br>

NTFS permissions are powerful permissions and they offer file and folder level security. NTFS permissions are useful for securing locally available resources.</br>

NTFS Features: </br>

File/folder level security</br>
Compress</br>
Encryption</br>
Quotas</br>
Reduced fragmentation</br>
Hot fixing</br>
Volume shadow copy services</br>
Mounting</br>
Separate recycle bin for each user</br>

NTFS permissions:</br>

Full control RWXDO</br>
Modify RWXD</br>
Read & Execute RX</br>
List folder contents L</br>
Read R</br>
Write RWX</br>

Implementing NTFS permissions:</br>

On member server-Create a folder</br>
On DC-Create 3 users.</br>
On member server</br>
Right click on the folder</br>
Properties</br>
Security</br>
Add the users we have created on DC</br>
Ok</br>
Select the user and set the permission</br>
U1-full control</br>
U2-modify</br>
U3-read</br>
Apply-ok.</br>

Experiment2: </br>

Login as administrator on member server</br>
Create a folder</br>
Folder properties</br>
Security</br>
Advanced-uncheck the box allow inheritable permissions..</br>
Remove</br>
Apply – ok.</br>
Add the users we have created along with the administrator</br>
Administrator -full control</br>
U1 – full control</br>
U2 – modify</br>
U3 – read – apply – ok</br>

Full control permissions</br>
This permission offers complete control i.e., taking ownership and setting permissions on files and folders.</br>
Users who have full control permission can take ownership of a resource</br>
The moment a user creates a folder he becomes an owner of a folder.</br>
Owners will have full control access</br>

Taking ownership of a folder: </br>

On member server</br>
Login as administrator</br>
Create a folder</br>
Go to properties of the folder</br>
Security</br>
Add the user to whom we want to give permission</br>

Profiles </br>

Profiles are used for providing basic user environment needs</br>
Environment needs can be</br>

Desktop settings</br>
Startup applications</br>
N/w connectivity.</br>

Profile is responsible for providing the initial desktop environment needs with the help of desktop folder, favorites, cookies, my documents, start menu, and Internet settings, n/w connections and etc.</br>

When a user logs in for the first time the user will be loaded with a default user profile.</br>
Default user profile is located under</br>
C:\documents and settings\default user</br>

Types of profiles:</br>

1)Local profile</br>
2)Roaming profile</br>
3)Mandatory profile</br>

Local profile: </br>

It is a profile loaded for the user and saved in the local hard drive where the user works.</br>
And profile will be saved when a user logs off</br>
Local profiles are limited only to the machine where they are saved.</br>
A user with a local profile will not be loaded with a network profile when he logs on from another machine.</br>

Verifying the type of the profile: </br>

My computer</br>
Properties</br>
Advanced</br>
User profile – settings</br>

Roaming Profile: </br>

It is a profile, which is saved in the shared folder on the server. Hence available in the entire network.</br>
Roaming profile is a n/w profile which is available in the entire network. As a result when a user logs in from any machine in the n/w he will be loaded with a roaming.</br>

Creating a roaming profile: </br>

On DC</br>
Create a user A/C</br>
Create a folder</br>
And share it and give full control permission for everyone</br>
Start >P>ADUC</br>
Double click the user</br>
Profile</br>
Profile path ex: \\sys1\profile\username</br>
Apply – ok</br>

Move on to member server:</br>

Log in as user</br>
My computer</br>
Properties</br>
Advanced-profile settings-you should notice “roaming profile”.</br>

Mandatory Profile: </br>

Mandatory Profile is a profile used for controlling desktop environment setting especially used for restricting user from saving user data, setting, and configuration on the desktop.</br>
It is a type of roaming profile but settings are not saved when a user logs off.</br>
Changes will be available only for the session where user is active. (Active session)</br>

Creating a mandatory profile: </br>

Open the profiles folder you’ve created for roaming</br>
There will be a user folder</br>
Take the ownership of the folder of the user</br>
Right click on the folder properties</br>
Security – ok – advanced</br>

Create a folder or delete a folder</br>

For removing mandatory profile just rename ntuser.man to ntuser.dat</br>

Home folders: </br>

Home folders are separate folders where users save their data and protect their data from other users every user can have one home folder either on the server on the local machine.</br>
If the home folder is in the server an administrator can secure it and back-up.</br>
If the home folders are created in the local machine backing up is not that easy.</br>

Creating a user home folder in a server: </br>

On member server</br>
Create a home folder for user1</br>
Share it</br>

Disk Quotas </br>

It is a new feature of 2000&03</br>
Using this feature an administrator can restrict the users from using disk space.</br>
i.e. an administrator can limit the size of the disk space usage.</br>




Quotas can be implemented in two ways: </br>

1)On computer basis (local machine)</br>
2)User basis (network resource)</br>

Quotas can be implemented only on NTFS volumes.</br>

Software Deployment </br>
It is a feature of 2000&03 can be implemented through group policies either on computers or users.</br>
It is a process of spreading out the software required onto the client machines when a user starts the computer.</br>
With the help of software deployment we can install, uninstall, upgrade, repair and add patches &service packets.</br>
Software deployment is possible only when the software is with .msi extension. (msi – Microsoft Installer)</br>
MSI provides the services like </br>
Installation</br>
Uninstallation</br>
Roll back</br>
Repair over the network.</br>

Software deployment is possible only with .msi or .zap extension.</br>
Using WININSTALLLE 2003 software we can convert *.exe files to *.msi files</br>

Setup.exe file cannot be deployed over the network but can be converted to setup.msi files with the help of the software ‘wininstall le2003’. This is the product of Veritas Company.</br>

Installing wininstall le2003 software</br>
On DC</br>
Open D or E drive</br>
Application folder</br>
Double click on wininstallle.exe</br>

Conversion Process</br>
Phase –I (before snap shot)</br>
In this wininstall le scans the complete system and the register and checks for installed applications. And takes the snap shot of the current condition of the OS.</br>


Phase- II (Installation) :</br>
In this phase we have to install the software, which we want to convert to .msi</br>

Phase – III (After snap shot) :</br>
In this phase wininstall le compares two previous states, before snap shot &installation and takes another snap shot with installation.</br>

Note: Using these three phases the Microsoft software installer can trouble- shoot or deploy the software.</br>

1) Publish</br>
If we use publish software will be available in control panel and can be installed when the user wants. (on demand)</br>

2. Assigned </br>
If we select assigned, s/w gets installed on the client machine when a user opens the application for the firstBackup </br>

It is a process of protecting user data or system state data on to separate storage devices.</br>
NT supported only one type of storage media, i.e. tapes.</br>
2000&03 supports tapes, floppies, HDDS (Hard Disk Drives), zip floppies, RSD (Remote Storage Devices)</br>

Back up utilities: </br>

The default backup utility provided by NT, 2000, 2003.</br>
NTbackup utility Comes along with the OS. Provides minimum benefits could have optimum benefits.</br>

There are some third part utilities </br>

1 Veritas - BackupExec</br>
2 Veritas - Foundation suite (for UNIX flavors)</br>
3 Veritas - volume manager</br>
4 Tivoli storage manager (IBM)</br>
5 Netback up</br>

Starting back up utility: </br>

On DC</br>
Or member server</br>
Start</br>
Run – ntbackup (or) start > programs> accessories>system tools>backup</br>

Backing up a folder: </br>

Create a folder in D drive and a file in that</br>
Start - run – ntbackup – click on advanced mode</br>
Back up</br>
Next</br>
Select 2nd option (backup selected files.)</br>
Expand my computer from D drive select the folder you’ve created</br>
Next</br>
Select the destination to save the back up</br>
Next – select the type of back up (ex. Normal)</br>
Check the box disables volume shadow copy</br>
Next – finish</br>

Verifying </br>

Delete the backed up folder</br>

Restoring the backed up folder: </br>

Start – run – (ntbackup)</br>
Advanced – restore – next</br>
Select the backed-up file – next – finish</br>

Back up types </br>

7 Normal</br>
8 Copy</br>
9 Incremental</br>
10 Differential</br>
11 Daily</br>

1. Normal Backup:</br>

It is a full backup backs up all selected files & folders after back up removes the Archie bit (A)</br>

Achieve Bit:</br>

It is a bit used by backup utility to know whether a file is backed up.</br>
It is used as a backup marker.</br>



2. Copy backup: </br>

Copy backs up all selected folders but does not remove archive bit after backing up. Copy is used between normal backup and incremental backup.</br>

3. Incremental backup: </br>

Backs up all selected files & folders which are changed since backup marks the files as having been backed up. Removes the archive bit after back up.</br>

4. Differential backup: </br>

Backs up all selected files & folders. After backup does not remove the archive bit. It backs up all the files changed since normal back up.</br>

5. Daily backup: </br>

It backs up all selected files & folders created or changed during the day after backed up does not remove the archive bit.</br>


Recommended backup strategy: </br>

1. If we select incremental back up it is faster and restoration is slower. I.e. more number of tapes have to be restored</br>
2. If we go with differential backup, backup is slow, but restoration is fast i.e., just by restoring 2 tapes.</br>


System state data: </br>

Components of SSD: </br>

12 AD</br>
13 Boot files</br>
14 System files</br>
15 Services</br>
16 Registry</br>
17 Com+inf</br>
18 Cluster info</br>
19 I.I.S.</br>



SSD is a data store if we want to backup complete AD we can back up system state data from backup utility.</br>


Taking a back up of system state data: </br>

Start - run – ntbackup – click on advanced mode </br>
–> backup – next-Select 3rd one system state data</br>
–> next – save in E drive -></br>
create a folder (SSD) in this folder create a file with filename .bkf </br>
–> next – advanced - next </br>
 time.</br>

3. Advanced: </br>
It is useful when we want to upgrades s/w, install service packs or patches etc…</br>
